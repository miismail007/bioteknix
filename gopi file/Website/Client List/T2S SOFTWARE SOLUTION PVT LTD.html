                  <p>The story of <b>TOUCH2SUCCESS</b> is one of them.</p>
                  <p>It all began when a young and dynamic computer specialist had a brilliant idea! Ardian started his career in computing from a very young age.  He was so passionate about working in IT, that despite being busy in full-time education, he started a part-time job fixing computers on the weekends. What started as a hobby, slowly turned into a business. In no time, the team grew to 4 people and it was time to find an office space. During that time, one of his clients asked him to design a website that would allow people to place food orders online.  Ardian saw an amazing opportunity. That was the moment that set Ardian on the path to creating the Touch2Success that we all know today.</p>

						<p>It's been a year since I stepped into T2S Development it still feels like day-one. The thing that I enjoy most about working for this company is the shared passion that everyone seems to have. Whether it's in building a product, testing or marketing, T2S employees seem to want to create the best possible product or experience. It's refreshing and empowering to work in an environment where people actually care about their work and want to do well. Team T2S strives hard to excel in their roles in-order to bring up excellence as a habit. <br> <br> One of the things I appreciate most about T2S is the role of Development and how development team is respected, valued, and collaborated with. Throughout all levels at T2S, people recognise and show appreciation for the hard work and dedication that IT team members put forth. <br> <br> T2S organisation structure is flat where everyone's idea,thoughts are being accommodated and accomplished as part of product releases. This understanding, combined with T2S base culture, makes way for an outstanding collaborative environment.</p>
